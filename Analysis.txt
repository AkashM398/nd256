Task0
    Runtime Analysis: O(1)
    Explanation: My approach to solve the task involves looking up a value in nested array, which takes constant time since the indices are known beforehand.
    
Task1
    Runtime Analysis: O(n)
    Explanation: My approach to solve the task involves iterating over items in texts and calls array, which takes linear time i.e the longer the texts and calls arrays are respectively,
                the longer it takes to arrive at the total number of unique telephone numbers.

Task2
    Runtime Analysis: O(nÂ²)
    Explanation: My approach to solve the task involves two for-loop iterations; through calls array nested in one looping through all unique telephone numbers. The nesting results in taking quadratic time to arrive at solution.

Task3
    Runtime Analysis: O(n)
    Explanation: My approach to solve the task involves iterating through the calls array and checking for patterns that fit the solution. This takes linear time.

Task4
    Runtime Analysis: O(n)
    Explanation: My approach to solve the task involves iterating through the texts and calls arrays separately. Arriving at the solution would take longer if both arrays were to grow, hence linear time.
