### Code Design

I implemented my solution using merge sort algorithm to sort the input array, so as to pick the digits that would form solution in reverse order.

### Efficiency

##### Time complexity

- The merge sort algorithm takes O(n log n)
- The operation to rearrange digits involves iterating over sorted array which takes linear time; O(n)

##### Space Complexity

- The space taken by my solution increases proportionally to the input; O(n)
