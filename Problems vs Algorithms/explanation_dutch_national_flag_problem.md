### Code Design

I implemented my solution using quicksort algorithm with the middle of the input list as my pivot.

### Efficiency

##### Time complexity

- The quick sort algorithm takes O(n log n)

##### Space Complexity

- The space taken by my solution increases proportionally to the input; O(n)
