### Code Design

I implemented my solution by iterating through the input array while updating the value of `min_int` and `max_int` by comparing each element in the list.

### Efficiency

##### Time complexity

- It takes linear time to arrive at a solution for the `min_int` and `max_int`; O(n)

##### Space Complexity

- The space taken by my solution increases proportionally to the input; O(n)
