### Code Design

I implemented my solution using recursive binary search algorithm as a nested method in the `rotated_array_search` for easier usage of the number variable.

### Efficiency

##### Time complexity

- It takes logarithmic time to get the result; O(log n)

##### Space Complexity

- The space taken by my solution is not affected by the input; O(1)
